    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa crate timing sidechannel (Marvin Attack)
    # Reason: This project uses SQLite only, not PostgreSQL.
    # The rsa crate is a transitive dependency via sqlx-postgres which is
    # not used in our application. No RSA operations are performed.
    # Will remove this ignore once upstream provides a fix.
