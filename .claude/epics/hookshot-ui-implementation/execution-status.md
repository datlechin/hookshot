## Coordination Strategy

**Agent #27 (API Client) leads:**
1. Create types first → Commit → Allows other agents to proceed
2. Then implement API client
3. Then implement hooks

**Agents #28, #29, #30 follow:**
1. Wait for types to be committed
2. Start implementing UI components
3. Integrate hooks as they become available
4. All work in same branch, coordinate via git commits

## Branch Status

- **Branch:** `epic/hookshot-ui-implementation`
- **Base:** `main`
- **Ahead by:** 2 commits from #26
- **Working directory:** `/Users/ngoquocdat/Projects/epic-hookshot-ui-implementation`

## Next Actions

- Monitor agent progress (you'll be notified when each completes)
- After #27, #28, #29, #30 complete → Start #31, #32 in parallel
- After all complete → Merge epic branch to main
